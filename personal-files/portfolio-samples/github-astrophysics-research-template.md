## Key Projects / Files

Please see README for more information

**Research Significance**: Discovered and made first real-life measurement of a novel physical barrier for galaxy clusters. Used machine learning, data science, and statistical analysis to show evidence of physical significance at this boundary. Also used techniques to understand the mass distribution of matter in the Universe in large-scale simulations, based on proposed physics theories.
