## Session 1: Template Setup
**Date:** 2025-11-02  
**Duration:** In Progress  
**Participants:** AI Assistant (Code Mode)

### Objectives
- Implement the AI Project Assistant Template structure
- Create all necessary workspace files
- Set up persona system
- Prepare template for first use

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Initial Setup
- Read `setup_instructions.md` to understand implementation requirements
- Read `README.md` and `AI_PROJECT_ASSISTANT_PROMPT.md` to understand template design
- Created todo list for systematic implementation

#### 2. Core Workspace Files Created
- ✅ `.ai-workspace/README.md` - Documents workspace structure and file purposes
- ✅ `.ai-workspace/session-start.md` - Provides quick session orientation
- ✅ `.ai-workspace/context-summary.md` - High-level project overview and design decisions
- ✅ `.ai-workspace/progress.md` - Milestone tracking and current status
- ✅ `.ai-workspace/session-log.md` - This file, interaction history

### Decisions Made

1. **File Creation Order:** Started with documentation files before persona system
   - Rationale: Establishes context before creating specialized components

2. **Content Approach:** Provided comprehensive, self-documenting content
   - Rationale: Template should be immediately usable without external documentation

3. **Status Tracking:** Using progress.md for milestones, session-log.md for details
   - Rationale: Different granularities serve different purposes

### Next Steps
1. Create personas directory structure
2. Create all persona files (JSON + MD for each)
3. Create active-personas.json configuration
4. Create test-checkpoints directory
5. Verify complete structure

### Issues / Blockers
None currently.

### Notes
- Template structure is clear and well-documented
- Persona system design follows the pattern from AI_PROJECT_ASSISTANT_PROMPT.md
- All files include helpful context and examples
- Ready to proceed with persona creation
