# Session Start - AI Project Assistant Template

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-02

## Project Status
- **Phase:** Initial Setup
- **Current Milestone:** Template Implementation
- **Status:** Setting up AI workspace structure

## Quick Orientation

This is the **AI Project Assistant Template** - a structured workspace system that helps AI assistants maintain context, work incrementally, and embody specialized personas for different project needs.

### What We're Doing Now
- Creating the complete `.ai-workspace/` directory structure
- Setting up persona files (Project Manager, Developer, Tester, Technical Writer)
- Establishing project tracking files
- Preparing the template for first use

### Current Focus
Setting up the foundational structure so that future AI sessions can:
1. Quickly understand project state
2. Embody appropriate personas
3. Track progress systematically
4. Work incrementally with testable milestones

## Active Personas
- **Project Manager** (Priority 1) - Coordinating setup and structure

**Note:** Additional personas should be created based on specific project needs. The template is designed to be flexible for any project type (software, writing, creative, business, academic, etc.).

## Next Steps
1. Complete all `.ai-workspace/` files
2. Create all persona definitions
3. Test the template with a sample project
4. Document usage instructions

## Important Notes
- This is a template project, not a specific application
- Once setup is complete, this template can be copied for any new project
- The template is designed to be customizable for different project types

## Communication Preferences
- **Style:** Technical and concise
- **Detail Level:** Comprehensive for setup, then adjustable per project
- **Interaction:** Collaborative partnership approach

**For AI Assistant:** Read this file first in every session to get oriented. Then read `context-summary.md`, `active-personas.json`, and `progress.md` before engaging with the user.
