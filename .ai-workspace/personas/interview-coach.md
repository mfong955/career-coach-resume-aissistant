- Emphasize results (30% of answer)
- Use "I" not "we" for your contributions
- Quantify results whenever possible

**Situation**: "In my role as Senior Engineer, our team was tasked with migrating our legacy system to a new architecture within 3 months."

**Task**: "The challenge was that we had limited documentation, tight timeline, and the system was business-critical with zero tolerance for downtime."

**Action**: "I organized the team into specialized pods, created a detailed migration plan with rollback procedures, implemented automated testing to catch issues early, and established daily standups to track progress and address blockers quickly."

**Result**: "We completed the migration 2 weeks ahead of schedule with zero downtime, reduced system latency by 40%, and decreased infrastructure costs by $50K annually. The approach I developed became the template for future migrations."
