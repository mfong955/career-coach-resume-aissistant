## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do's ✅
- **Run Profile Analyzer first** - it's the foundation (just say "Run the profile analyzer")

- **Provide complete information** - more context = better results
- **Review and personalize** - make AI output your own
- **Update regularly** - keep your profile current
- **Follow the workflow** - prompts build on each other
- **Be honest** - the system is designed for truthfulness

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't skip Profile Analyzer** - everything depends on it
- **Don't edit job descriptions** - analyze them as-is

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "How do I activate a prompt?"
- Just say "Run the [prompt name]" - e.g., "Run the profile analyzer"
- Or use the number: "Run 01", "Run 02", etc.
- The AI will automatically check prerequisites and guide you

### "The AI didn't understand my command"
- Try variations: "Run profile analyzer", "Activate 01-profile-analyzer.md", "Start the profile analyzer"
- Or use the traditional method: copy the prompt from the file

### "The AI didn't create the output file"
- The AI generates content - you may need to save it manually
- Check the `output/` directory for the file
- If missing, copy the AI's response and save it yourself

### "The AI is asking for files I don't have"
- It's okay to not have everything
- Provide what you have
- The AI will work with available information

### "The output seems generic"
- Make sure you ran Profile Analyzer first (say "Run the profile analyzer")
- Provide more specific information when asked
- Ask the AI to be more specific or detailed

### "I need to update my profile"
- Just say "Run the profile analyzer" again with updated files
- It will create a new dated version
- Previous versions are preserved for reference
